# Simple English Language Policy

Policy Owner: Engineering Maintainers

Repository default language is simple English.
This applies to ADRs, documentation, issue/PR comments, and code comments.

## Rule
- Write clear and short sentences.
- Prefer common words over complex wording.
- Avoid idioms, slang, and ambiguous phrasing.

## Allowed Exceptions
- Technical terms that are standard in software engineering.
- Product names, library names, and protocol keywords.
- Code identifiers and exact error messages.

## Scope
- Mandatory for new content.
- Mandatory for updated sections in touched files.
- Legacy content outside change scope may remain unchanged.

## PR Requirement
PR descriptions and review comments should be in simple English.
If non-simple wording is required for precision, add a short justification.

## Non-Compliant
- New ADR or docs written in non-English language without reason.
- Complex wording when simple wording is sufficient.
- Updated comments or docs in touched sections not aligned to simple English.
